This is a web-based Expression Tree Builder and Evaluator developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user can input a postfix expression, and the system builds the corresponding expression tree, displays its in-order traversal, and evaluates the result, all on a beautifully animated interface.

🌟 Features
✅ Build a binary expression tree from a postfix arithmetic expression.
✅ Display the in-order form of the expression with proper parentheses.
✅ Evaluate the expression tree and display the final result.
✅ Animated gradient background and glowing input effects.
✅ Responsive and mobile-friendly UI.
✅ Real-time error validation for invalid or empty input.
